# app/database.py
#
# Owns MongoDB connection lifecycle for the app. TWO connections are
# maintained, deliberately, for different reasons:
#
#   ASYNC client (AsyncMongoClient) — used for everything: our own
#   repositories, knowledge sync inserts/deletes, session/document
#   storage. PyMongo's native async API, NOT Motor (deprecated, EOL
#   May 2026 — see earlier ADR).
#
#   SYNC client (MongoClient) — used ONLY for constructing
#   MongoDBAtlasVectorSearch for the similarity_search() retrieval
#   path. Confirmed: every official LangChain/MongoDB example,
#   across every version checked, constructs this class with a
#   synchronous pymongo collection — there is no async-native
#   variant of MongoDBAtlasVectorSearch itself. Calls through this
#   client are wrapped in asyncio.to_thread() at the call site
#   (see app/knowledge/search.py, not yet built) so they don't block
#   the event loop — this is the ONE place in the codebase we accept
#   a sync/async mismatch, confined as narrowly as possible.
#
# Both connections are stored on app.state, not as module-level
# globals — see earlier ADR on why (test isolation, multiple app
# instances not sharing state via bare module globals).
